    "We all seek a purpose in life and a reason to arise in the morning. Our prayer for you is that each morning these six components will point you to your creator the Son of God, Jesus Christ.\nLet Morning Mustard be your morning motivation to know, and to love, and to walk with God.\n\nThe first component is “Walking in the Spirit.”\nAs you tap on the first acronym, words will appear in the oval, think deeply about the meaning. Then tap on the symbol for that acronym, and pray with consideration to the given ideas. Proceed with the remaining acronyms and symbols.\n\nThe second component is to “Put on the Armor” of God. This is an important daily routine, for we are in a Spiritual battle.\nTap on any piece of armor at the bottom of the screen and it will place on the Soldier. Then tap on the armor piece positioned on the soldier, and a word bubble will appear with your prayer. Tap on the bubble and the prayer will present in larger print. Tap on the print to clear it away and proceed with the remaining five pieces of armor.\n\nThe third component is the calendar of your “prayers today” this helps remind you each day to pray for your loved ones or important subjects.\nTo set up for daily use, tap on a particular square and then scroll through the drawings in the bottom left corner. Tap on the face or object which best resembles your loved one/subject, and it will appear in the square. Then continue with each square in the calendar, until it is complete.(To fill in the four squares inside the red frame, move the frame to a different day, and those squares will become accessible.)\nTo label each square, tap on the “i” in the top right corner, and “add” or “delete” will appear. Tap on “add” and type in the name of your loved one or subject, tap “ok” and it will label.\nWhen using your Morning Mustard daily, tap on the corresponding day of the week and the red rectangle will move to frame the four particular people/subjects for which to pray. Don’t forget to pray for your two “everyday” squares.\n\nThe fourth component is “My Burden box” this is important for His peace will pass all understanding when you have put your troubles in His care.\nTap on your Burden Box, it will open and your prayer will appear in a red oval. Tap on the coin under the padlock and a text box will emerge. Type in your burden and tap on the blue check to store it in your Burden Box.

Then tap on the blue check to store it in your heart. To review Thy Word hidden in your heart, tap on your heart, and your verses will appear.\n\nThe sixth component is “My Thoughts,” this is important for when you have sinful thoughts you can rid of them to the authority of Jesus Christ never to be seen again. Type your thoughts into the text box and they will be taken captive and removed.\nThe “Train” is a reminder to formulate your choices and beliefs by facts, not feelings. This habit allows you to determine fact from fiction, truth from lies, and feelings from reality. Your feelings may be a red flag, but let facts drive your decisions.\nLastly, NEVER EMPTY your mind. Meditate on His Word, and on whatever is true, honest, just, pure, lovely, admirable, excellent, or praiseworthy—think on these things.…\n\nIf you have any further questions, feel free to contact:\nMyMorningMustard@ Gmail.com\n\nSOURCES:\nWhat doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all His ways, and to love Him.\nDeuteronomy 10:12\n\nWhat doth the Lord require of thee, but to...humble thyself to walk with thy God.\nMicah 6:8\nAnd my tongue shall declare Your righteousness\nAnd Your praise all day long.\nPsalms 35:28\n\nIf we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
